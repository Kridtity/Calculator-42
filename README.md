# Calculator-42
Command line calculator using Python language, using the Shunting Yard Algorithm and Reverse Polish notation to evaluate expressions.

## Why?
This program was written as a joke for a Year 12 Computer Science ATAR assessment. This program went way beyond the scope of the assessment tasksheet, so now it sits in an independant repo.
